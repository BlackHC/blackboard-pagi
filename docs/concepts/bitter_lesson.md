# Bitter Lesson

## Introduction (ChatGPT^*)

In his essay "The Bitter Lesson," Richard Sutton discusses the history of artificial intelligence (AI) research and the importance of leveraging computation in order to make progress in the field. He cites several examples, such as computer chess and Go, where initially researchers focused on utilizing human knowledge and understanding of the domain, but ultimately it was the methods that relied on computation and search that were most successful. He also discusses the shift from human-knowledge based approaches to statistical and computational methods in fields such as speech recognition and natural language processing, and the recent success of deep learning in these areas. Sutton argues that the deep learning revolution has led to a "bitter lesson" for reinforcement learning researchers, as deep learning has been largely unable to solve the problem of reinforcement learning and has shifted focus and funding away from the field. He remains optimistic about the future of reinforcement learning, however, and believes that continued investment and support for research will ultimately lead to progress in the field.

## Application to PAGI

Instead of defining various complex concepts that cannot be traded off easily, we will focus on the basics instead and define a system that could in principle improve more easily with more computation and by improving the underlying models.
