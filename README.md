> **Warning**
> This is a research project and does not do what the name implies at all currently.

> The repo was started for the LLM Hackathon by Ben's Bites (winter 2022) but then became more of an infrastructure playground.

Highlights:

- Hyperparameter tracking;
- LLM execution tracking;
- Advanced @llm_function decorator that truly supports **generic** Pydantic models;
- Black-Box Function Optimization example using LLM and generic task description.

Everything released under AGPL 3.0.

I hope to contribute and extract the infrastructure features to other projects and packages.

Feel free to contact me if there is interest.
